https://127.0.0.1:5000/

https:-hyper text transfer protocol - basically set of rules (it will transfer the data from frontend to backend and vice versa)

127.0.0.1- ip address location of the virtual server [local ip address which means it will work on locally where flask application developed]
5000- port number just like a flat or house number

/ -> called as route

domain name- it will replace the ip address ip address hiddenly attch with domain name 


whatever business logic we will write that should be  between the initialisation and route

app=Flask(__name__)

Q.why we use __name__?

ans: so that flask can figure it out where the template or static folder located
